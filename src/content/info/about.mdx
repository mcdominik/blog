# Who Am I

I’m a software engineer and open-source enthusiast. I believe that sharing knowledge is one of the best ways to grow—both as an individual and as a community.

My main areas of interest are programming and electronics. I do my best to verify everything I publish, but as you probably know, bugs and mistakes are an inevitable part of building anything worthwhile. If you spot an error or something inaccurate on this site, please let me know. I’m always open to learning and updating my views when presented with better information.
